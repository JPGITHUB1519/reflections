How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having a entire history of a file helps us recover and old version of our file
    for differents purposes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

       Pro :

   1- We have a logical control of our versions
   2- automatically saved is not efficient in coding

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

     Because the others have the purpose to handle individual files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   I can use the git log to see the commits in the history of files.
   I can use git diff to see the differents changes between the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
