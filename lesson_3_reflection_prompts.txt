When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I want use a remote repository when i want to share my project and let the other people add new changes and modifications.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because pulling the changes manually i can decide
	when i want to do it.
